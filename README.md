Fundscout
=========

**Disclaimer: Don't use this software, unless you know what you're doing**

Fundscout is a graphical application to help making future decisions based on your funds.

Motivation
----------

Most money managing applications are:

    * hosted on the web and therefore can leak private data to third parties
    * don't talk to your bank
    * aren't free software
    * won't let you control your data

That's why I want an application where I have control over my data.
Furthermore I want an application which presents the data in such a way,
that I can make informed decisions for future investments (however
large or small they might be).

Prerequites
-----------

    * Ghost.py (https://github.com/jeanphix/Ghost.py) > 0.1b2
    * PySide
