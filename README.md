Fundscout
=========

Fundscout is a desktop application to manage your funds.

Motivation
----------

Most money managing applications are either:

    * hosted on the web and therefore can leak private data to third parties
    * don't talk to your bank
    * aren't free software
    * you loose control over your data

**Disclaimer: Don't use this software, unless you know what you're doing**
