Fundscout
=========

Fundscout is a desktop application to manage your funds.

Motivation
----------

Most money managing applications are either:

    * hosted on the web and therefore can leak your credentials to
      third parties
    * don't talk to your bank
    * you loose control over your data

This is why I created fundscout. Which has the aim to:

    * keep control over your data
    * aids on making future investment decisions or simply keeping an
      eye on your expenses.
